# Bad Narrations — Do NOT Write These

## Empty Praise (about the kid, not the scene)
- "Wonderful work! You successfully completed the task!"
- "Great job providing detailed instructions for the monster's party!"
- "You've shown excellent prompt engineering skills!"
- "The party was perfect because you described everything so well!"

## Edu-Jargon (classroom language)
- "You've demonstrated strong prompt engineering capabilities!"
- "Your description showed great attention to detail!"
- "Excellent use of specific language in your instructions!"

## System Language (scary/cold)
- "Error: insufficient detail provided."
- "Task completed successfully."
- "Input processed. Scene generated."

## Preachy Fails (lectures instead of comedy)
- "Oops! That didn't quite work out. Don't worry, mistakes are how we learn!"
- "Almost! You're getting better at writing prompts!"
- "Not quite right, but keep trying!"

## Too Long (over 20 words)
- "The skeleton warrior carefully arranged the blue banners and the red banners on the walls of the dark dungeon while the knight watched."

## Why These Are Bad
- They talk ABOUT the kid instead of describing the scene
- They use banned words: "prompt", "skills", "learning", "error", "Great job!"
- They break the 4th wall (acknowledge this is a game/exercise)
- Fails aren't funny — they're preachy or condescending
- Over 20 words kills the pacing
