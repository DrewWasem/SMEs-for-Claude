# Bad Feedback Tips — Do NOT Write These

## Abstract Theory (teaching prompting, not playing a game)
- "Remember, good prompts should address all parts of the problem."
- "Try to think about potential obstacles and include solutions."
- "A complete description includes who, what, where, and how."
- "Consider breaking your instructions into clear steps."

## Vague / Unhelpful
- "Be more specific next time."
- "Try harder!"
- "Add more details."
- "Think about what's missing."

## About the Kid (not the game world)
- "You forgot some important details."
- "Your prompt was missing key information."
- "You need to include more elements in your description."

## Uses Banned Words
- "Your prompt needs more specificity." (uses "prompt")
- "Great job, but try adding more!" (uses "Great job!")
- "You're learning to be more detailed!" (uses "learning")
- "Your skills are improving!" (uses "skills")

## Why These Are Bad
- Kids don't need prompting theory — they need to know what happened IN THE GAME
- "Be more specific" gives zero actionable guidance
- Feedback about the kid feels like a grade, not a game
- Banned words break the brand voice contract
