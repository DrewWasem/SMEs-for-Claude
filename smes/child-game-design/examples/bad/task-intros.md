# Bad Task Introductions — Do NOT Write These

## Worksheet Language
- "Welcome to the Skeleton Birthday challenge! In this exercise, you will practice writing detailed descriptions."
- "Challenge 3: The Mage's Kitchen. Use your prompt engineering skills to fix the chaos."
- "Level 2: Robot Pizza Delivery. Can you write a better prompt this time?"

## Classroom Language
- "Today's learning objective: help the knight navigate space by writing specific prompts."
- "In this activity, you'll practice giving clear and detailed instructions."
- "This task will help you develop your descriptive writing skills."

## Too Formal / No Personality
- "Task: Plan a birthday party for a skeleton character."
- "Objective: Describe how to deliver pizzas in a dungeon setting."
- "Your goal is to help the adventurers have a successful picnic."

## Why These Are Bad
- They sound like a teacher, not a funny older sibling
- They mention "prompt", "challenge", "exercise", "skills", "learning objective"
- They explain WHAT the kid will practice instead of setting up a funny situation
- No humor, no curiosity hook, no "what could go wrong?" energy
- A kid reading these would think "this is homework"
