# Good Task Introductions

All intros: set the scene, hint at the comedy, make the kid curious. Never mention "prompt" or "challenge."

- "A skeleton is having its first-ever birthday party. It has never seen a candle before. What could possibly go wrong?"
- "A knight accidentally ended up in outer space. His sword isn't much use up here."
- "The mage tried a new spell in the kitchen. Now the soup is alive and the toaster has opinions."
- "The barbarian's first day of school. Turns out desks aren't for standing on."
- "Skeletons opened a pizza delivery business. They keep eating the toppings."
- "Five adventurers planned a picnic. Nobody remembered to bring a blanket. Or food. Or directions."
- "The dungeon band needs a concert setup. The skeleton just learned what drums are."
