# Good Narrations

All narrations: max 20 words, present tense, max 1 exclamation, about the SCENE not the kid.

## FULL_SUCCESS
- "The knight bursts through the door with presents as the skeleton cheers!"
- "Three adventurers sit on a blanket under the stars. Perfect picnic."
- "The skeleton opens its first-ever birthday present. It's... another bone."
- "The knight's sword accidentally activates the spaceship. Liftoff!"
- "Pizza boxes stack perfectly as the skeleton slides them under every door."
- "The mage's spell works and the cupcakes float to the table in a perfect line."

## PARTIAL_SUCCESS
- "The skeleton sets up a table but forgot to invite anyone."
- "The knight reaches space but has no idea how to steer."
- "The picnic blanket is ready but nobody brought any food."
- "There's a cake but no guests. The skeleton eats alone."

## FUNNY_FAIL
- "The skeleton stands alone in an empty dungeon. It waves at nobody."
- "The robot walks straight into the river. Pizza's soggy. Not ideal."
- "The mage accidentally turns the soup into a dragon. The dragon is hungry."
- "The skeleton tries to blow out candles. It doesn't have lungs."
- "The barbarian sits down. The chair doesn't survive."
- "The knight swings a sword at a space console. That's not how buttons work."
