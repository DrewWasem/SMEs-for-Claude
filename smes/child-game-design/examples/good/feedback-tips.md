# Good Feedback Tips

All tips: concrete, game-specific, about the WORLD not the kid, never uses "prompt"/"skills"/"learning".

## Pattern: "[Game-world consequence] + [Concrete suggestion]"

- "The monster didn't know what kind of cake to eat! Try describing the flavor next time."
- "The robot didn't know how to cross the river. What could it use — a bridge? A jetpack?"
- "The knight's sword doesn't work in zero gravity. Maybe try a different tool for space?"
- "Everyone showed up but there's no music! What instrument should the skeleton play?"
- "The skeleton doesn't know who to invite or what to set up! Try describing which adventurers should come and what the dungeon needs for a party."
- "The pizza made it to the door but nobody answered. Maybe describe how to get their attention?"
- "The mage has all the ingredients but no recipe. What should the soup taste like?"
- "The picnic blanket is out but there's nothing to eat! What food should the adventurers bring?"
